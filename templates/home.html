<h2>The UW Webservice Registry provides a list of web services that you can make use of,<br/>and a place to advertise and communicate your web service.</h2>

<p>The registry is open to all UW people - it is intended as a public resource that serves two main goals. First, to allow UW people who maintain web services to make them official - registration will provide services with a reserved namespace and make them visible to campus technology coordinators. Second, the registry allows UW people to browse for, locate and learn about applications that may be useful to them.</p>

<h2>Looking for a service?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a source of data or functionality on campus, please <a href="/service/browse/">browse the registry.</a> You'll find information on what applications are availabe, who runs them, and how to use them.</p>

<h2>Have a service to share?</h2>
<p>Please <a href="/service/add/">register it!</a> This is the easiest way to get exposure for your application, and the registry maintainers will help you with all the details.
